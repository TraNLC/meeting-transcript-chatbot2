  "summary": "A brainstorming session was conducted to generate new e-commerce platform features, aiming to boost user engagement and conversion rates. Over 20 ideas were proposed, including AR try-on, AI stylists, and one-click checkout, with associated technical and logistical challenges also discussed. Through voting and prioritization, one-click checkout, personalized recommendations (ML), and a customer support chatbot emerged as top priorities. The team decided to implement one-click checkout, a chatbot, and a loyalty program in Q1 2026 with a $500K budget, while postponing high-risk features like blockchain and a social feed. Action items were assigned to key team members to begin development and research for these prioritized initiatives.",
