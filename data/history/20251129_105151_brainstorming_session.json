  "summary": "TÓM TẮT:\n\nCuộc họp động não này nhằm mục đích phát triển các tính năng mới cho nền tảng thương mại điện tử để tăng cường tương tác người dùng và tỷ lệ chuyển đổi. Nhiều ý tưởng từ trải nghiệm người dùng (thanh toán một chạm, thử đồ AR) đến đổi mới kỹ thuật (đề xuất cá nhân hóa ML) đã được đưa ra, cùng với các lo ngại về tài nguyên và bảo mật. Sau quá trình phân loại, bỏ phiếu và phân tích tính khả thi, các ưu tiên hàng đầu cho Quý 1/2026 bao gồm triển khai thanh toán một chạm, chatbot hỗ trợ khách hàng và chương trình khách hàng thân thiết. Ngân sách 500.000 USD đã được phê duyệt cho Giai đoạn 1, đồng thời các tính năng như blockchain và mạng xã hội bị hoãn vô thời hạn, với các nhiệm vụ cụ thể được giao cho nhóm để thực hiện lộ trình đã đề ra.",
