  "summary": "TÓM TẮT:\nCuộc họp động não này tập trung vào việc phát triển các tính năng mới cho nền tảng thương mại điện tử nhằm tăng cường tương tác người dùng và tỷ lệ chuyển đổi. Các nhóm đã đưa ra hơn 20 ý tưởng đa dạng, từ trải nghiệm người dùng (thanh toán một click, AR try-on) đến đổi mới kỹ thuật (đề xuất cá nhân hóa ML, chatbot), đồng thời thảo luận về các thách thức và rủi ro. Sau quá trình phân loại và bỏ phiếu, các tính năng ưu tiên hàng đầu được quyết định triển khai trong Giai đoạn 1 (Q1 2026) là **thanh toán một click**, **chatbot hỗ trợ khách hàng** và **chương trình khách hàng thân thiết**, với ngân sách $500K được phân bổ. Các tính năng như công cụ đề xuất ML cũng sẽ được bắt đầu phát triển, trong khi blockchain và social feed bị hoãn vô thời hạn.",
